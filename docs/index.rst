DASK Metadata Capture Library
========================================

The DASK Metadata Capture Library exists to consume metadata as generated by the [Mofka-Dask coupler](https://github.com/GueroudjiAmal/MofkaDask/). The scripts' primary purpose is to consolidate the generated `.csv` files into a singular, object-focused output such that it can be compared against and combined with other metadata.
